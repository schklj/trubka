# TRUBKA
XLR lo-fi microphone from a vintage handset with passive filters.

I would generally recommend cranking up gain on the sound card when using the dynamic microphone and setting it to the lowest setting when using the carbon mic.

Filters don't work well with the dynamic mic because they make it really quiet.

# Potential upgrades
* zener regulate phantom power and power carbon mic with it
